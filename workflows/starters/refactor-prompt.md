# Code Refactoring & Dependency Upgrade

## Mission
Systematically improve code quality, maintainability, and security through targeted refactoring and dependency updates while preserving functionality.

## Analysis Phase

### 1. Code Quality Assessment
- Identify code smells, duplicated logic, and overly complex functions
- Look for inconsistent patterns or outdated practices
- Find opportunities to improve readability and maintainability
- Check for proper error handling and logging patterns

### 2. Architecture Review
- Assess module organization and separation of concerns
- Look for tightly coupled components that could be loosened
- Identify opportunities for better abstraction or composition
- Review naming conventions and API design

### 3. Dependency Analysis
- Examine current dependencies and their versions
- Identify outdated packages with security vulnerabilities
- Check for unused or redundant dependencies
- Look for opportunities to reduce bundle size or improve performance

### 4. Performance Opportunities
- Identify performance bottlenecks or inefficient algorithms
- Look for memory leaks or resource management issues
- Check for opportunities to optimize database queries or API calls
- Assess caching strategies and data structures

## Improvement Strategy

### 5. Prioritized Refactoring Plan
Focus on high-impact, low-risk improvements:
- **Critical**: Security vulnerabilities and breaking dependencies
- **High**: Code that frequently changes or causes bugs
- **Medium**: Performance optimizations and code quality improvements
- **Low**: Style improvements and minor optimizations

### 6. Safe Dependency Updates
- Update patch versions first (backward compatible bug fixes)
- Then minor versions (backward compatible new features) 
- Major version updates require careful testing and migration
- Check breaking change logs for each upgrade

### 7. Incremental Implementation
- Make small, focused changes that can be easily tested
- Preserve existing functionality and behavior
- Add tests for refactored code where missing
- Document any API or behavior changes

## Quality Assurance

### 8. Testing Strategy
- Ensure all existing tests continue to pass
- Add new tests for refactored functionality
- Verify performance hasn't degraded
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### 9. Risk Mitigation
- Keep changes small and focused
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Document breaking changes clearly
- Have rollback plans for risky changes

## Output Requirements
Provide:
- Clear rationale for each proposed change
- Impact assessment (benefits vs risks)
- Testing strategy for validating changes
- Migration notes for any breaking changes
- Priority ranking of improvements
